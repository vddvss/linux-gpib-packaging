This repo contains RPM spec files and patches for the 
[linux-gpib project](https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/) drivers and library for
GPIB (IEEE-488) adapters.

It has been updated to the SVN 2053 version from the [linux-gpib project](https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-gpib/code/HEAD/tree/)

These are targeted at Fedora and RHEL/CentOS 7, but they can probably be made to
work with SUSE or other RPM distros, though I haven't bothered to put in all of
the logic to do that. The package also tries to adhere to the
[Fedora packaging guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/).

# Installation

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable vddvss/linux-gpib

sudo dnf install dkms-linux-gpib linux-gpib
```

**IMPORTANT**: If you are using the HP/Agilent/Keysight 82357A, 82357B, 82341C,
82341D, or 82350A, or the NI GPIB-USB-B, you will also need to install the
appropriate firmware package available at
https://github.com/vddvss/linux-gpib-firmware-packaging. No firmware is needed for
the NI-GPIB-USB-HS/HS+.

## Extra Packages

| Tcl                 | `tcl-linux-gpib`      |

# Device setup
These packages include new `udev` rules and an updated device initialization
process using `systemd`.

If you have more than one adapter connected or if you want to change the minor
number for the gpib device node (e.g. for `/dev/gpib1`, the minor number is 1),
you will also need to add a custom `udev` rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d` to connect
the device to the minor number. The priority of the `udev` rule must be less
than 60.

For example, to setup an Agilent 52357B with the serial number MY12345678 that
you want to access at `/dev/gpib1`, you could add the following to 
`/etc/udev/rules.d/59-my-gpib-adapter.rules`. The minor device number is set by
the value of the `ID_GPIB_MINOR` variable.

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \
    ATTR{idVendor}=="0957", ATTR{idProduct}=="0718", \
    ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT}=="MY12345678", ENV{ID_GPIB_MINOR}="1"
```

Note that for the Agilent 82357B, the `ID_SERIAL_SHORT` may not be the same as
the number printed on your adapter--I think this may be an artifact of the
firmware upload. To find out the correct serial number to use, run 
`udevadm monitor -u -p`, plug in the adapter and look for the correct number.
For the NI-GPIB-USB-HS, you may need to prepend a 0 to the serial number printed
on your adapter (i.e. 1234567 becomes 01234567).

After doing this, run:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

# Notes
These packages have only been tested on Fedora 28 with a Agilent/Keysight 82375B
USB adapter and a NI-GPIB-USB-HS adapter. Other versions of Fedora and other
adapters should work, but please open an issue or submit a pull request if you
run into problems.

## Patch notes
This repo contains several patches to upstream, including one to change the
`udev` rules to use a `uaccess` tag for the device nodes, instead of setting the
access mode and group. As a result, users will not need to be in the `gpib`
group in order to use the adapter, and the device will be accessible to logged
in users.

To restore the default behavior, create a file at
`/etc/udev/rules.d/61-linux-gpib-defaults.rules` with the following contents:

```
ACTION!="remove", KERNEL=="gpib[0-9]*", MODE="0660", GROUP="gpib", TAG-="uaccess"
```

After doing this, run:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

If you have already plugged in an adapter (which loads the kernel module), you
will need to unplug it and run:

```bash
# for Agilent 82357A/B
sudo modprobe -r agilent_82357a gpib_common

# for NI-GPIB-* adapters
sudo modprobe -r ni_usb_gpib gpib_common
```

The priority of this `udev` rule must be greater than 60 but less than 70.

# Changelog

Version 4.2.0 of the upstream driver changed the device initialization process
to allow USB adapters to be used without editing the `gpib.conf` file. Prior
versions of this repo included the `linux-gpib-defaults-agilent-82357a` and
`linux-gpib-defaults-ni-gpib-usb` packages, which changed this file to set the
default adapter.  These packages are no longer needed and have been removed from
the repository.

# Credits
There are quite a few installation guides and packaging specfiles for Linux-GPIB
floating around online, since installing and packaging Linux-GPIB can be
somewhat challenging. So credit goes to all those who have posted their
instructions.

In particular, the `dkms.conf` file is adapted from the
[Arch AUR linux-gpib-dkms repo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-gpib-dkms/).
The [PLD Linux spec](https://github.com/pld-linux/linux-gpib/blob/master/linux-gpib.spec) 
was also quite helpful in putting this file together.
